# CSS Display Property

`block` - reserves the full width of the parent container. Will not allow other elements to sit next to it. Can be affected with `width` and `height` properties.

`inline` - defaults to the "natural" size of it's contents. Allows other `inline` or `inline-block` elements to sit next to it. Can not be affected by `width` and `height` properties.

`inline-block` - "best of both worlds", acts like an `inline` element, but also allows for changes to the `width` and `height` property.
